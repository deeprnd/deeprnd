# Shaping the Future of Programmable Data

I'm Vic, an engineer and builder driving real-world impact through bleeding-edge infrastructure across Solana, Polkadot, Ethereum, and modern clients.

My north star: ship 1B+ USD worth of decentralized systems to accelerate global autonomy, intelligence, and transparency — at scale.

## My Current Focus 🧑‍💻

I am heavily involved in working with network performance bottlenecks, building blockchain data pipelines, and solving complex data problems in decentralized infrastructure and protocols.

Presently: `Solana`, `Substrate`, `EVM`, `Rollups`, `Layer2`, `Data Infrastructure`, `P2P Networking`,  `Node Architecture`, `Local-First Systems`, and `Compute Over Data`
